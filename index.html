        <p class="para-1" style="font-family: Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif;">This photo is of
            Blair at lunch on Thursday 9/14 absolutely DEVOURING the school lunch (as she does). As the image depicts,
            she has made a taco with the chicken tenders and lettuce wrapped inside the school waffle. Looks delicios!
            Blair tends to get a bit possesive of her food as we see here...</p>

            <p class="para-2">This photo is Blair and I from quite a while ago! We are in the basement by the stem room and makerspace spying on people. You can also tell its an old photo because of my grown out purple hair. This is one of those like, rounded corner mirrors that convenience stores have to stop people from stealing or something like that idrk ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ But yeah anyway because we are obsessed with ourselves we took this lovely picture and its just so super silly I love it.</p>

            <p class="para-3" style="font-family: monospace;">I love Blair soooooooooo much she's my pretty little girl. I love her so much, in fact, that I made this shirt in her honor!! It's a gorgeous picture of her with the words "Я Люблю Блерь," meaning, "I love Blair."</p>
